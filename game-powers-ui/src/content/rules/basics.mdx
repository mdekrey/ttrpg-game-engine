# What is D&D: Matt's Edition?

![Leveraging combat rules of the 4th edition of
D&D.](qr:https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/110213/DD-RPG-Starter-Set-Quickstart-4e)
These rules create a new setting-agnostic fantasy TTRPG where players run
characters who perform impressive feats through magic or intense martial
training. Since I never intend to publish this, rather than building from
scratch, we'll leverage the basic rules of the 4th edition of D&D for combat.
This should play similarly to D&D without the complexity of editions 3 and 5 but
also without the restriction of limited content from 4th edition.

With that in mind, many things are omitted from the free starter set from the
full D&D 4e... but there will be just as many differences.

## Three Basic Rules

As noted in the 4e Starter Set, there are 3 basic rules.

1. The core mechanic: Roll a d20 + modifiers and compare against a target number.
    - Bonuses of the same type do not stack; keep the largest bonus. For
    example, a +6 proficiency bonus from a skill does not stack with a +1
    proficiency bonus from your level modifier; keep only the +6.
    - Bonuses without a type stack.
    - All penalties stack.
2. Specific beats general: There are many exceptions; the most specific rule takes precedence.
3. Always Round Down: If you get a fraction as the result of a calculation, round down.

## Abilities

Six ability scores make a simple description of every creature's capabilities.
The abilities are as follows:

* **Strength** measures physical power.
* **Constitution** measures health, stamina, and vital force.
* **Dexterity** measures hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, and balance.
* **Intelligence** measures ability to reason and learn.
* **Wisdom** measures common sense, perception, self-discipline, and empathy.
* **Charisma** measures force of personality, persuasiveness, and leadership.

Ability scores are 0-based, and most humanoids range from -2 to +2 for the
scores. Player characters often push those limits up to +5. Most creatures
become disabled or killed if any ability score is dropped to -5.

### Selecting Abilities

1. Assign in any order the following scores: +3, +2, +1, +1, +1, 0
2. Purchase scores with a budget of 20 points from the following list:

    | Score | Cost |
    | ----: | ---: |
    | -1    | -2   |
    | +0    | 0    |
    | +1    | 2    |
    | +2    | 5    |
    | +3    | 9    |
    | +4    | 16   |

## Bonuses

Some bonuses have a type, such as a feat bonus, a proficiency bonus, a power
bonus, etc. Only the highest

## Powers

Actions taken within encounters are defined by powers. Some powers are basic;
every character gains access to them. Others are granted through skills, class
levels, magic items, special training from organizations, boons from deities, or
any number of other sources.

Each power defines how often they may be used. **At-will** powers are as often
as you choose. **Encounter** powers recharge after a short rest. **Daily**
powers recharge after a long rest.

## Classes

Every character gets a custom class, granting unique powers based on the class's tools
of the trade and the class's special training.

## Skills

Skills are a collection of training, mindsets, and capabilities that round out a
character beyond the standard class skills and training. Some may be due to a
character's background, granted due to racial features, or learned during the
course of adventuring.

As your character advances, you assign points to skills, indicating how trained
in a skill you are. When rolling an ability check, if a skill applies to the
situation, you may add that skill's points as a proficiency bonus.

## Feats

Most feats give you small, static bonuses to one of the numbers on your
character sheet.

Some feats have prerequisites; you must meet the prerequisites before selecting
the feat. If you no longer meet the prerequisites, you lose the benefits of the
feat.

## Levels

As characters adventure and gain experience, they advance in level. Characters
advance in several ways every time they gain a level.

Any ability check may use 1/2 your level (your level mod) as a proficiency
bonus.

**\* At these levels you replace a known power with a new power of your new
level**

### Retraining

As your character advances, sometimes there are choices that you have made that
you wish to change. Each time you gain a level, you may choose one of the
following options to retrain your character:

* **Feat**: Replace one feat with another. You cannot replace a feat if it is a
prerequisite for anything else.

* **Power**: Replace one power with another of the same category (usage
frequency and level).

* **Skill**: Transfer a number (up to your level modifier) of skill points from
one or more skills to a single skill. You may only transfer points to a single
skill as part of retraining, but those points may be transferred from multiple
other skills.
