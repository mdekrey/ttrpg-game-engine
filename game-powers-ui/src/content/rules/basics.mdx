# What is D&D: Matt's Edition?

![Leveraging combat rules of the 4th edition of
D&D.](qr:https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/110213/DD-RPG-Starter-Set-Quickstart-4e)
These rules create a new setting-agnostic fantasy TTRPG where players run
characters who perform impressive feats through magic or intense martial
training. Since I never intend to publish this, rather than building from
scratch, we'll leverage the basic rules of the 4th edition of D&D for combat.
This should play similarly to D&D without the complexity of editions 3 and 5 but
also without the restriction of limited content from 4th edition.

With that in mind, many things are omitted from the free starter set... but
there will be just as many differences from the original 4th edition of D&D.

## Abilities

Six ability scores make a simple description of every creature's capabilities.
The abilities are as follows:

* **Strength** measures physical power.
* **Constitution** measures health, stamina, and vital force.
* **Dexterity** measures hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, and balance.
* **Intelligence** measures ability to reason and learn.
* **Wisdom** measures common sense, perception, self-discipline, and empathy.
* **Charisma** measures force of personality, persuasiveness, and leadership.

Ability scores are 0-based, and most humanoids range from -2 to +2 for the
scores. Player characters often push those limits up to +5. Most creatures
become disabled or killed if any ability score is dropped to -5.

### Selecting Abilities

1. Assign in any order the following scores: +3, +2, +1, +1, +1, 0
2. Purchase scores with a budget of 20 points from the following list:

    | Score | Cost |
    | ----: | ---: |
    | -1    | -2   |
    | +0    | 0    |
    | +1    | 2    |
    | +2    | 5    |
    | +3    | 9    |
    | +4    | 16   |

## Powers

Actions taken within encounters are defined by powers. Some powers are basic;
every character gains access to them. Others are granted through skills, class
levels, magic items, special training from organizations, boons from deities, or
any number of other sources.

Each power defines how often they may be used. **At-will** powers are as often
as you choose. **Encounter** powers recharge after a short rest. **Daily**
powers recharge after a long rest.

## Classes

Every character gets a custom class, granting unique powers based on the class's tools
of the trade and the class's special training.

## Skills

Skills are a collection of training, mindsets, and capabilities that round out a
character beyond the standard class skills and training. Some may be due to a
character's background, granted due to racial features, or learned during the
course of adventuring.

## Levels

As characters adventure and gain experience, they advance in level. Characters
advance in several ways every time they gain a level.
