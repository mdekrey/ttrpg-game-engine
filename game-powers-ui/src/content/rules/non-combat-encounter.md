# Non-Combat Encounters

Whether shopping for equipment, navigating a ball, negotiating with scoundrels,
or sneaking through a guarded castle, non-combat encounters are a staple of
role-playing games. These rules help to give organization to the variety of
socialization that can occur.

> ### Non-Combat Rounds and Turns
>
> - **Round:** In a round, every active participant takes a turn. A round can
>   represent anywhere from the duration of a combat round to a day - or longer.
> - **Turn:** On your turn, you take an action. Although many combat actions
>   (standard, move, and bonus actions) can often fit within a non-combat turn,
>   non-combat turns include one major action and one minor action.

Not every non-combat situation needs to be structured as an encounter; these
rules should apply only when the players are not all acting as a team or another
outside influence opposes their actions.

The actions in a non-combat encounter happen concurrently in the game world,
with those acting earlier in the round setting the pace and constraints for
those later in the round. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of
each round in the encounter by rolling initiative.

---

A non-combat encounter follows these steps:

1. **Determine active participants.** The DM determines whether any NPCs are
   actively participating in the encounter from the start.
2. **Establish stakes.** One or more end conditions for the encounter should be
   established by the DM with help from the players. Stakes may be as simple as
   "the market closes," "we are done shopping," or "the ball ends" or as
   consequential as "the guards catch you" or "the duke discovers your true
   intentions."
3. **Roll initiative.** Every participant involved in the encounter rolls
   initiative, determining the order of participants' turns. Initiative is
   rolled at the beginning of each round.
4. **Take turns.** In initiative order, every participant takes a turn, which
   includes various actions. Participants who wish to act together take their
   turn on the latest initiative of the group.
5. **Begin the next round.** When every participant has had a turn, the round
   ends.
6. **End the encounter.** Repeat steps 3 through 5 until the stakes have been
   resolved.

## Determining Participants

Not every character present for a social encounter acts as a participant. Some
characters may simply be observers (the majority of the nobility at the ball,
the crowd watching a race or contest) or simply unaware or passive (guards doing
their jobs preventing intruders.) Some NPCs may be participants (other
competitors in the race or another partygoer with a grudge to settle) but either
change or up the stakes.

## Establishing Stakes

Every non-combat encounter should have stakes in order to keep the flow moving,
and the players should understand the stakes for the encounter for it to feel
meaningful.

- A pie-eating contest could be arbitrated with the stake of "last character
  standing."
- A climbing race might have the stake "first character to reach the top."
- An auction would have the stakes "all goods are sold" and "everyone runs out
  of money."
- A fancy ball would likely have several stakes such as "the ball ends," "the
  party is kicked out of the ball," "Lord Levington leaves the ball," or "Lord
  Levington reveals his plans."
- Tresspassing through a guarded castle would have stakes such as "reach the
  treasure hall" and "get caught by the guards."
- Making a path through the wilderness may have stakes such as "find your way to
  your destination" or "discover something unexpected." These stakes lend room
  for a random encounter, arcane discovery, or anything else that might be in
  the wilderness and indicates to the participants that they should keep their
  eyes open.

When any of the stakes conditions are met, the encounter structure should end
and free-play should resume.

Most stakes should be given a clock to represent progress (or countdown) to that
situation and ideally have consequences for those steps. Using a visual
represntation, such as a clock, helps players to recognize the progress being
made in the same way that a battle mat helps to understand the layout of a
combat encounter.

## Initiative

Before each round of the encounter, you make an initiative check. An initiative
check an ability check and follows the normal rules for ability checks. Based on
the stakes and expected actions for the round, the DM will set the ability score
for initiative.

- A pie-eating contest would likely use the Constitution score.
- A climbing race probably would use the Strength score (if it's more about
  athletics to climb the cliff itself quickly), but some situations may call for
  Dexterity (to see who can scramble the fastest) or Constitution (in the case
  of an endurance race.)
- An auction may use either Intelligence or Wisdom, depending whether the items
  are all what they seem and how much the participants are eying each other.
- A fancy ball likely calls for a Charisma-based initiative check.
- Tresspassing through a guarded castle could be a Dexterity check (for
  sneaking), but if participants are trying to talk their way past guards,
  Charisma may make more sense.

Throughout an encounter, participants act in order, from highest initiative
result to lowest. The order in which participants take their turns is called the
**initiative order.** The initiative order changes based on the initiative
checks from round-to-round, although a participant's position in the order can
be controlled via delaying.

> ### Non-Combat Initiative Checks
>
> To determine a non-combat encounter's initiative order, roll initiative. To do
> so, make an ability check.
>
> ---
>
> Roll 1d20 and add the following:
>
> - One-half your level
> - Your ability for the encounter
> - Any bonuses or penalties that apply
>
> The result is your initiative for this round of the encounter.

When participants have the same initiative, make a secondary initiative check to
resolve the tie. Alternatively, if the participants are acting on the same team,
one may choose to delay intentionally to grant initiative to the others instead
of running a tie breaker.

# Action Types

A non-combat round is made up of scenes, each with one action. Scanning a shelf
for an interesting item, negotiating with a shopkeeper, tracking a target for a
stretch, or eating a pie in a contest &mdash; each of these activities,
including many others, can be a single scene and a single action.

## The Main Action Types

A typical scene includes only three types of actions: major actions, side
actions, and quick actions.

> ### The Main Action Types
>
> - **Major Action:** Major actions are the core of non-combat encounters. You
>   take one major action on your turn. Most major actions are resolved via a
>   skill check and progress towards the stake of the participants' choice.
> - **Minor Action:** Minor actions are enabling actions, simple actions that can
>   lead to more exciting actions, or ones that minorly change the situation for
>   other participants. _Examples:_ knocking some loose rocks toward a
>   competitor in a rock climbing race, pointing out a safe path over difficult
>   terrain in the wilderness to a friend, appraising an item at an auction, or
>   making a quick bluff to change another participant's opinion.
> - **Quick Action:** Quick actions take almost no time or effort with regard to
>   the non-combat encounter. Actions that normally take place in a combat
>   round, such as quaffing a potion or walking some distance, qualify as a
>   quick action. The DM can restrict the number of quick actions in a turn.

# Taking your Turn

When your turn comes up in the initiative order, it's time for you to act. While
combat actions are typically not used during non-combat encounters, your turn
follows the same structure: the start of your turn, the scene for your turn, and
the end of your turn.

## The Start of Your Turn

Before you act, you keep track of certain effects. The start of your turn always
takes place, even if you're unconscious or delaying, and it takes no time in the
game world.

> ### The Start of Your Turn
>
> - **Ongoing Effects:** Some effects may occur at the start of your turn.
> - **End Effects:** Some effects end automatically at the start of your turn.
> - **No Actions:** You can't take any actions at the start of your turn.

## The Scene for Your Turn

During your turn, you get to be the highlight of the scene. You decide what to
do with each of your actions and how you want to approach the situation,
narrating how your character behaves or acting it out. See "Action Types" above
for definitions of the different actions you can take.

> ### Actions on Your Turn
>
> - **Your Actions:** You get the following two actions on your turn:
>   - Major Action
>   - Minor Action
> - **Quick Actions:** You can take any number of quick actions on your turn.
> - **Any Order:** You can take your actions in any order you wish, and you can
>   skip any of them.
> - **Substitute Actions:** You can take a second minor action instead of a major
>   action.
> - **Other Participants' Actions:** Other participants can take quick actions
>   on your turn.

## The End of Your Turn

After you act, you keep track of any effects that stop at the end of your turn
or that continue. The end of your turn always takes place, even if you're
unconscious or delaying, and it takes no time in the game world.

> ### The End of Your Turn
>
> - **Ongoing Effects:** Some effects may occur at the end of your turn.
> - **End Effects:** Some effects end automatically at the end of your turn.
> - **No Actions:** You can't take any actions at the end of your turn.

# Actions in Non-Combat Encounters

During your turn, you can choose from a wide variety of activities for your
scene. Usually, the most important decision you make is what to do with your
major action each turn. Do you do the most obvious thing to get to your goal, or
do you try a more subtle path to ensure you're on better footing when you do
make your move?

For the most part, major actions will be specific to the non-combat encounter;
as a result, they aren't listed here. During a pie-eating contest, your major
action would be eating pies, which could be a Constitution ability check. If
you're trying to buy a specific item at an auction, Wisdom may be best suited
for gauging other participants' interests. Chatting up socialites at a ball
would involve Charisma-based checks.

## Aid Another

You use your minor action to aid another participant. Describe how you're assisting
as part of your scene. You can use this action to aid someone else's skill check
or ability check.

> ### Aid Another: Minor Action
>
> - **Same Skill or Ability Check:** You can aid a skill check or an ability
>   check made by an adjacent ally. Make a DC 10 skill check or ability check.
>   If you succeed, you give a +2 bonus to your ally's next check using the same
>   skill or ability.
> - **Different Skill or Ability Check:** Describe how you're helping and
>   decalare which skill you're trying to boost. It must be plausible to help in
>   this manner. Make a DC 10 skill check or ability check; the DM will
>   determine which skill for you to use. If you succeed, you give a +2 bonus to
>   your ally's next check using the declared skill.
>
> In either case, this bonus ends at the end of the ally's next turn.

## Delay

You can choose to wait to take your turn until later in the round. You can wait
until after your allies' turns so you can build off of their actions, or you can
wait for opponents so you can counteract their progress.

> ### Delay: No Action
>
> - **Delay Entire Turn:** You must delay your entire turn, so you can't delay
>   if you've already taken an action on your turn.
> - **Coming Back into the Initiative Order:** After any other participant has
>   completed a turn, you can step back into the initiative order. Perform your
>   actions as desired.
> - **Losing a Delayed Turn:** If you choose to delay past the end of the turn
>   such that all other participants have acted, you lose your turn, but you do
>   not roll for initiative. Instead, you may continue to choose when to come
>   back into the initiative order and may act first in the turn if you choose.
> - **Start of Your Turn:** At the moment, you delay, carry out the start of
>   your turn normally.
> - **End of Your Turn:** You don't have a normal end of your turn. Instead, the
>   things you do at the end of your turn happen at two separate times.
>
>   _End Beneficial Effects when You Delay:_ At the moment you delay, end
>   effects that last until the end of your turn and that are beneficial to
>   you or your allies. You can't prolong a beneficial effect by delaying.
>
>   _End Harmful Effects after You Act:_ After you return to the initiative
>   order and take your actions, end effects that last until the end of your
>   turn and that are harmful to you. You can't avoid a harmful effect by
>   delaying.

## Hinder Another

You use your minor action to hinder another participant. You can use this action
to apply a penalty to someone else's skill check or ability check.

> ### Aid Another: Minor Action
>
> - **Skill or Ability Check:** Describe what you're doing to hinder. It must be
>   plausible to cause a complication in this manner. Make a DC 10 skill check
>   or ability check; the DM will determine which skill for you to use. If you
>   succeed, you give a -2 penalty to your opponent's next check. This penalty
>   ends if not used by the end of the participant's next turn.

## Prepare

You use your major action to prepare for your next turn. You can use this action
to apply a bonus to a skill check or ability check you make in the future.

> ### Prepare: Major Action
>
> - **Skill or Ability Check:** Describe what you're doing to prepare and
>   declare which skill you're trying to boost. It must be plausible to gain a
>   benefit in this manner. Make a DC 10 skill check or ability check; the DM
>   will determine which skill for you to use. If you succeed, you gain a +2
>   bonus to a check you make before the end of your next turn using the
>   declared skill.
