# Projects

In the course of your characters' lives, there will be some actions they wish to
take that require a larger investment than even a single [major
action](/rules/non-combat#The-Main-Action-Types). These projects can be the way
your character spends downtime, a source of side quests, or even a way to solve
a major plot.

Some examples include:

- Construct an magical sword
- Ingratiate yourself with the local nobility
- Locate the tomb of an ancient hero
- Rennovate a mansion
- Conduct a thriving business
- Prepare a ritual of massive proportions
- Gain specialized training

Projects allow us to:

- Gloss over the details of how your character accomplishes a goal to ensure the
  game continues to move without getting overly deep in minutia.
- Have the long-term project be the result of more than
  one roll of the dice.
- Have a shared understanding of how far along the project is and how long it
  will take to complete.

Projects may be advanced during non-combat encounters, when they make sense,
with a major action allowing one round of progress on the phase. Outside of
encounters, 1 week is a typical timeframe for a round on a project.

## Designing a project

A project consists of one or more phases, each tracked by progress clocks. A
progress clock is a visual game tool that looks like a circle cut into slices,
like a pie. (It can also be a simple progress bar, or tally count.)

A project plan consists of:

- The overall goal for the project
- The number of phases to complete the project
- The details for (at least) the first phase of the project (see the following
  section)

Some projects may require a more open-ended number of phases; this should not be
over-used. Players and characters alike need to know when projects will end to
feel like they are making progress.

### Phase Design

A phase needs to have the following details:

- A rough description of what completing the phase means
- A progress clock indicating the complexity of the phase. (This should have no
  more than 12 ticks.)
- A definition of the unit of time for a round. A typical round for a project is 1 week.
- A definition of how difficult the phase is. Phases can be automatic (the clock
  ticks for any tangible amount of effort in a round) or have a DC (the clock ticks only if
  a DC is exceeded.) There may also be other DCs to gain additional ticks on the
  clock for great rolls.
- Any other in-game costs or requirements to work on the phase. (Materials, a
  workshop, access to a library containing the information, etc.)

Phases may not have only one way to complete them, and you may solicit help from
other players or NPCs as is normal for gameplay.

## Example Projects

Because projects are so varied, here are a few examples.

### Constructing a Masterpiece Sword

Bendar the journeyman weaponsmith wishes to construct his masterpiece - a sword
fit for heroes. Working with the GM, he determines that the project should be 3
phases long:

1. Find a reliable source of Adamantine
2. Forge the blade
3. Add the finishing touches

Bendar wants to ensure his blade passes the guild's test to be admitted as a
master, so wants only the best metal - he'll need adamantine. In addition to
being expensive, it is also rare, even in the dwarven markets. To establish a
source for himself, he'll need both coin and connections. The phase is
established as:

<ProjectPhase
	advancement={[
		{
			check: 'DC 15',
			result: '1 tick'
		},
		{
			check: 'Each +5 on result',
			result: '+1 tick'
		}
	]}
	cost="1 gp must be spent per attempt to make bribes, purchase drinks, pay taxes and fees, etc."
	check="Varies"
	goal="Find a reliable source of Adamantine"
	totalTicks={4}>
	<p>In some situations, the GM shares, additional gold could be spent for additional ticks.</p>
</ProjectPhase>

Bendar decides to carouse with his other weaponsmithing contacts; a night on
the town may loosen their lips to a source. Spending 1gp, he rolls his Social,
and gets an 23. <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block" currentTicks={2} totalTicks={4} />
Bendar hears of a lead with the merchant's guild, but no actual source yet.

Bendar unfortunately has "merchants" as his neglected social type; Bendar
doesn't bargain well, and doesn't get along with those who do. He needs to try,
though, so tries the same tactic - 1gp later and a lucky roll of a 15, he inches
towards his goal. <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block" currentTicks={3} totalTicks={4} />

The merchants didn't have adamantine to sell directly, but directed him towards
a band of adventurers who had been retrieving bits of adamantine on a
semi-regular basis, if he promised to give the guild its due. Bendar tries to
convince the adventurers, but an unlucky roll of 12 causes him to be challenged
by guards expecting customs and import fees: he spends his 1gp on fines and is
left without a lead.

Hearing of his encounter with the guards, a local dealer in the black market
approaches him and offers to... take care of it for him. Bendar, frustrated and
feeling without much choice, pays the shady man's price of 10gp and gains access to the
adamantine he desires. <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block" currentTicks={4} totalTicks={4} />

With an admittedly expensive source of adamantine available, the next phase is established:

<ProjectPhase
	advancement={[
		{
			check: 'DC 20',
			result: '1 tick'
		},
		{
			check: 'DC 25',
			result: '2 ticks'
		}
	]}
	cost="20 gp must be spent per attempt to purchase adamantine via the black market."
	check="INT + Weaponsmithing"
	goal="Forge the Blade"
	totalTicks={8}>
	<p>
		Adamantine is difficult to work with, and requires a steady supply to continue crafting. Use of a workshop is
		required, but Bendar has access to one through membership in the guild.
	</p>
</ProjectPhase>

And so, Bendar's project progresses. With a +15 bonus in weaponsmithing, his clock progresses:

<ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={0} totalTicks={8} />
→ <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={0} totalTicks={8} />
→ <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={2} totalTicks={8} />
→ <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={4} totalTicks={8} />
→ <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={5} totalTicks={8} />
→ <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={6} totalTicks={8} />
→ <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={7} totalTicks={8} />
→ <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={8} totalTicks={8} />

Bendar spends a total of 7 down-time rounds forging the blade, purchasing 140gp
worth of adamantine via the black market. Not all of this was sequential; he
needed to serve some other duties for the guild during this time in order to pay
for the materials.

While the hilt and the other decorations will be easier to work with, Bendar
wants to do an exceptional job to impress the other masters of the guild. These
decorations aren't strictly weaponsmithing, instead requiring a variety of other
crafting skills. Fortunately, Bendar cannot ruin the adamantine blade, so a
minimum result is not required... which is good, because Bendar doesn't have
much skill in the other areas. The final phase is established:

<ProjectPhase
	advancement={[
		{
			check: 'Any',
			result: '1 tick'
		},
		{
			check: 'Each +5 on result',
			result: '+1 tick'
		}
	]}
	cost="20 gp must be spent per attempt to purchase embellishments, including fine leather, gemstones, silver for inlays, etc."
	check="INT + Crafting"
	goal="Add the finishing touches"
	totalTicks={12}>
	<p>Use of a workshop is required, but Bendar has access to one through membership in the guild.</p>
</ProjectPhase>

Through a series of other rolls, Bendar makes progress:

<ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={0} totalTicks={12} />
→ <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={4} totalTicks={12} />
→ <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={6} totalTicks={12} />
→ <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={7} totalTicks={12} />
→ <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={10} totalTicks={12} />
→ <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={12} totalTicks={12} />

Another several weeks later, and 100gp of materials, Bendar finally has his masterpiece completed.

### Locating the Shield of Saint Yularia

As followers of Corellon, the party's cleric Aenwyn and the party's paladin
Tarric are tasked with recovering a relic: the Shield of Saint Yularia. The
exact whereabouts are unknown, but they gain access to the temple library to
begin their search.

Working with the GM, a project is established to identify the location of the
shroud; recovering it doesn't make sense to be part of a project. Two phases
will be used:

1. Find information on the final resting place of the Shield
2. ...? The GM only reveals that there will be a second phase, but not what it is.

Knowing that the shield was lost more than an elven generation ago, the first
phase becomes a difficult task.

<ProjectPhase
	advancement={[
		{
			check: 'DC 15',
			result: '1 tick'
		},
		{
			check: 'DC 25',
			result: '2 ticks'
		}
	]}
	check="Varies"
	goal="Find information on the final resting place of the Shield"
	totalTicks={8}>
	<p>
		Tracking old knowledge is difficult and time consuming. The library is an option, but the characters may use any
		creative means to track down the information.
	</p>
</ProjectPhase>

- Aenwyn and Tarric both get to work searching the library for information. Between the two of them, they roll a 17 and
  an 8, resulting in only one tick:
  <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={1} totalTicks={8} /> Knowing this could otherwise take a
  while, the party's bard Perren hits the town for digging up old legends and songs to help. Unfortunately, Perren only gets
  a 13, and doesn't assist with progress this round.
- Aenwyn and Tarric continue to hit the books, getting a 24 and a 20 after their skill bonuses. Perren continues to talk
  to people in taverns to find old stories, this time earning a 25. Together, the clock advances. <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={5} totalTicks={8} />
- A final sweep through the library results in a 24 and a 13, and one lucky story found by Perren ties all the research
  together with a 19. <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={8} totalTicks={8} />

The 3 characters spent 3 rounds together to learn that the Shield was lost
within Elmenor's Last Stand, but the precise location of the fortress was lost.
Fortunately, they were also able to find a sketch of the entrance and a partial
map of the inside of the fortress, and know its location based on several old
landmarks. The landmarks must be located as well, however, and that will require
talking with the locals of that area.

<ProjectPhase
	advancement={[
		{
			check: 'DC 10',
			result: '1 tick'
		},
		{
			check: 'DC 20',
			result: '2 ticks'
		}
	]}
	check="Variable"
	goal="Locate Elmenor's Last Stand"
	totalTicks={6}>
	<p>
		The landmarks will still be obvious, but a combination of exploration and talking with people from the villages in
		the area will make the best progress.
	</p>
</ProjectPhase>

This time the party's ranger, Thordor, is willing to help out - out of the city is his element. With the whole party
working together, they are sure to make quick progress.

- Aenwyn, Tarric, and Perren talk to people in town; Aenwyn and Tarric focus on the temples. With a 20, a 14, and a 21,
  they are able to gain 5 ticks <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={5} totalTicks={6} />, and
  given their information a quick scout by Thordor with a result of 16 allows them
  to complete the last phase of the project in one round. <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={6} totalTicks={6} />

With the fortress where Elmenor's Last Stand took place, the party gears up and heads into the dungeon, ready for whatever
challenges face them.
