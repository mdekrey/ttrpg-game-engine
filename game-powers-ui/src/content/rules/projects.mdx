# Projects

In the course of your characters' lives, there will be some actions they wish to
take that require a larger investment than even a single [major
action](/rules/non-combat#The-Main-Action-Types). These projects can be the way
your character spends downtime, a source of side quests, or even a way to solve
a major plot.

Some examples include:

- Construct an magical sword
- Ingratiate yourself with the local nobility
- Locate the tomb of an ancient hero
- Rennovate a mansion
- Conduct a thriving business
- Prepare a ritual of massive proportions
- Gain specialized training

Projects allow us to:

- Gloss over the details of how your character accomplishes a goal to ensure the
  game continues to move without getting overly deep in minutia.
- Have the long-term project be the result of more than
  one roll of the dice.
- Have a shared understanding of how far along the project is and how long it
  will take to complete.

## Designing a project

A project consists of one or more phases, each tracked by progress clocks. A
progress clock is a visual game tool that looks like a circle cut into slices,
like a pie. (It can also be a simple progress bar, or tally count.)

A project plan consists of:

- The overall goal for the project
- The number of phases to complete the project
- The details for (at least) the first phase of the project (see the following
  section)

### Phase Design

A phase needs to have the following details:

- A rough description of what completing the phase means
- A progress clock indicating the complexity of the phase. (This should have no
  more than 12 ticks.)
- A definition of how difficult the phase is. Phases can be automatic (the clock
  ticks for any tangible amount of effort) or have a DC (the clock ticks only if
  a DC is exceeded.) There may also be other DCs to gain additional ticks on the
  clock for great rolls.
- Any other in-game costs or requirements to work on the phase. (Materials, a
  workshop, access to a library containing the information, etc.)

Phases may not have only one way to complete them, and you may solicit help from
other players or NPCs as is normal for gameplay.

## Example Projects

Because projects are so varied, here are a few examples.

### Constructing a Masterpiece Sword

Bendar the journeyman weaponsmith wishes to construct his masterpiece - a sword
fit for heroes. Working with the GM, he determines that the project should be 3
phases long:

1. Gathering the materials
2. Forge the blade
3. Forge the hilt and add finishing touches

Bendar wants to ensure his blade passes the guild's test to be admitted as a
master, so wants only the best metal - he'll need adamantium. In addition to
being expensive, it is also rare, even in the dwarven markets. To establish a
source for himself, he'll need both coin and connections. The phase is
established as:

> <ClockSvg className="w-16 h-16 float-right mr-2 mb-2" currentTicks={0} totalTicks={4} />
> 4-ticks, minimum DC 15 to increase, but will tick an additional 1 for each 5 that the DC is exceeded. 1 gp must be spent
> per attempt, which can be through bribes, purchasing drinks, taxes or fees, or anything else creative. In some situations,
> the GM shares, additional gold could be spent for additional ticks.

Bendar decides to carouse with his other weaponsmithing contacts; a night on
the town may loosen their lips to a source. Spending 1gp, he rolls his Social,
and gets an 23. <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block" currentTicks={2} totalTicks={4} />
Bendar hears of a lead with the merchant's guild, but no actual source yet.

Bendar unfortunately has "merchants" as his neglected social type; Bendar
doesn't bargain well, and doesn't get along with those who do. He needs to try,
though, so tries the same tactic - 1gp later and a lucky roll of a 15, he inches
towards his goal. <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block" currentTicks={3} totalTicks={4} />

The merchants didn't have adamantium to sell directly, but directed him towards
a band of adventurers who had been retrieving bits of adamantium on a
semi-regular basis, if he promised to give the guild its due. Bendar tries to
convince the adventurers, but an unlucky roll of 12 causes him to be challenged
by guards expecting customs and import fees: he spends his 1gp on fines and is
left without a lead.

Hearing of his encounter with the guards, a local dealer in the black market
approaches him and offers to... take care of it for him. Bendar, frustrated and
feeling without much choice, pays the shady man's price of 10gp and gains access to the
adamantium he desires. <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block" currentTicks={4} totalTicks={4} />

With an admittedly expensive source of adamantium available, the next phase is established:

> <ClockSvg className="w-16 h-16 float-right mr-2 mb-2" currentTicks={0} totalTicks={10} />
> 12-ticks, DC 10 ticks 1, and DC 20 ticks 2. 20 gp must be spent per attempt to purchase adamantium via the black market.
> Use of a workshop is required, but Bendar has his own.

And so, Bendar's project progresses.
