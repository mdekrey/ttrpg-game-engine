# Rituals

Most spellcasting outside of combat takes place in careful rituals. Subtle
changes in an environment can cause unpredictable results for spells, so
a spellcaster's control must be precise to pull off the most powerful rituals.

## Preparing a location

Spellcasters often have a space dedicated for their spells to save time by
pre-calculating and permanently inscribing arcane symbols necessary for their
schools of magic. They can be widly varied in appearance depending on the type
of spells they are suited for, ranging from summoning circles to audience halls
to showcase illusions.

Preparing a locale for spellcasting for a single skill is a long-term project on
the scale of weeks, based on the maximum size for the effect. A typical prepared
locale for a Medium space (see [Sizes](/rules/basics#Sizes)) is as follows:

> <ClockSvg className="w-16 h-16 float-right mr-2 mb-2" currentTicks={0} totalTicks={8} />
> 100gp of arcane materials must be purchased, including inlays, gemstones, etc. Each round takes a week. Progress is tracked
> on an 8-tick clock, where an Intelligence-based DC 15 check for the ritual skill in question ticks 1, and a failure requires
> replenishing 10% of the cost of materials.

A larger or smaller space modifies the DC by the target size's Standard
Modifier, the clock ticks and initial cost of materials by the target size's
Standard Multiplier (see [Sizes](/rules/basics#Sizes)).

A single location may be used for multiple types of rituals, but creating the
circle becomes a multi-phase project: one phase for each ritual skill to be used
in the location. In addition, for each ritual skill beyond the first to be used,
the cost of materials doubles. Adding a new ritual skill to an existing space
only requires completing the new phase of the project, but requires the full
price in arcane materials. The space is unusable for any ritual while
construction is incomplete.

For example, Celwyn the elven spellcaster wishes to prepare a space for
medium-sized Abjuration, Conjuration, and Transmutation rituals. Such a space
will cost 800gp to create with three 8-tick clocks <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={0} totalTicks={8} /> <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={0} totalTicks={8} /> <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={0} totalTicks={8} />,
each requiring a DC 15 check for the corresponding skill to increase for each
step of the way. At best, she'll be done in 24 weeks; at worst, the project
will take longer and she'll need to replace 80gp of materials per failure.

Celwyn later decides she wants to add Divination to the space. It would only
take one more clock <ClockSvg className="w-em h-em inline-block m-2" currentTicks={0} totalTicks={8} />
but she'd need to spend the full 1600gp, and failures would cost 160gp. Celwyn
instead opts for an entirely new divination space, which will cost only 100gp.

## Becoming familiar with a prepared ritual location

A ritual location prepared by another spellcaster takes some getting used to.
Because every spellcaster has their own style, becoming familiar with a location
is necessary to gain the benefits of the prepared locale.

To become familiar with a prepared ritual location, a character must spend an
hour studying either the space itself or careful notes made for the purpose of
becoming familiar with the space. For example, a summoning circle may be
documented through an intricate drawing of the circle itself.
