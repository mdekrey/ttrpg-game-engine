# Conjuration

Conjurations can transport creatures or objects over great distances, even from
other planes, or create objects or effects on the spot.

## Challenge Checkpoints

Most conjurations are a minor action - they take too long to be effective in combat.

The base DC for any summoning is 10, which last for 1 hour, modified as follows:

| Target Description | Modifier |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Living Creature | +level |
| Living Creature with control | +5x level |
| Fine Object | +0 |
| Diminuitive Object | +1 |
| Tiny Object | +2 |
| Small Object | +4 |
| Medium Object | +8 |
| Large Object | +16 |
| Huge Object | +32 |
| Gargantuan Object | +64 |
| Colossal Object | +128 |

Other modifiers for objects include:

| Object Details | Modifier |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Raw materials | +0 |
| Crafted materials | +DC to create<br/>Or, make an additional crafting check. |
| Metal | x2 |
| Precious Metal | x5 |
| Crstaline | x10 |

Duration can be extended:

| Duration | Modifier |
| -------- | -------- |
| 1 minute | -5 |
| 1 day | +2 |
| 1 week | +5 |
| 1 month | +10 |
| 1 year | +20 |
| Permanent | +50 |

Teleportation depends on the quantity/size of targets, distance, and accuracy.
Base DCs assume 1 medium-sized creature or equivalent meterials.

| Teleportation | DC |
| ------------- | -------- |
| 100 miles | 15 |
| Anywhere on plane | 20 |
| Different plane | 25 |
| Unfamiliar location | +5 |
| General area | -5 |
| Double targets | +2 |

DCs for conjurations can be steep. Summoning a creature or object from elsewhere
or from nothing is not easy, but the ritual may be made more reliable through
use of special materials. Spending 100gp per point in the DC in incense, chalk,
and other specially prepared materials can reduce the DC by 1 point.

<p>For example, conjuring a permanent large bronze statue made to resemble a
specific person (crafting DC 25) would be DC 202. This can be reduced to a DC 20
check for {new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US').format(202 * (202 - 20) * 100)} gp. If
the conjurer also were a master sculptor, the base DC would be 152 with an
additional DC 25 crafting check, which could be reduced to a DC 20 check for
{' ' + new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US').format(152 * (152 - 20) * 100)} gp. Either way,
it would be cheaper for a sculptor to acquire the materials through mundane
methods if at all possible.</p>

Conjurers can form a special bond with living spirits summoned repeatedly
without control. Such spirits can take the form of a familiar, special mount, or
many other forms.
