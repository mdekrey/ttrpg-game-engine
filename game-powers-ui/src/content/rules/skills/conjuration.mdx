# Conjuration

Conjurations can transport creatures or objects over great distances, even from
other planes, or create objects or effects on the spot.

**Creation**: A creation spell manipulates matter to create an object or
creature in the place the spellcaster designates.

**Summoning**: A summoning spell instantly brings a creaure or object to a place
you designate for a period of time. When the spell ends or is dispelled, a
summoned target is instantly sent back to where it came from. A summoned
creature also goes away if it is killed or if its hit points drop to 0. It is
not really dead. It takes the creature 24 hours for the creature to reform where
it was summoned from, during which time it can't be summoned again.

**Teleportation**: A teleportation spell transports one or more creatures or
objects a great distance or even across planes. Teleportation typically moves
targets away from the caster, but a special type of teleportation, known as a
calling, draws creatures or objects to the caster.

## Challenge Checkpoints

Preparing a conjuration takes time, careful calculation, and arcane materials.
The complexity of a conjuration depends greatly on many factors, including (but
not limited to) the target locale of the conjuration, the source of the creature
or object, the size of the effect, and even the material makeup of the target.

### Summoning Circles

Conjurers often have a space dedicated for their conjurations to save time by
pre-calculating and permanently inscribing arcane symbols necessary for
conjuration. Prepared locations for conjurations are known as **summoning
circles**, but they may be used for any type of conjuration. See (see [Rituals:
Preparing a Location](/rules/rituals#Preparing-a-location)).

A conjuration with a summoning circle causes the DC to be 5 lower unless
otherwise specified.

### Creation

A typical creation takes an hour of time causes a medium-size amount of raw
mundane materials to appear.

TODO: cost? size? workmanship?

### Summoning

A typical summoning draws a particular extraplanar creature or object to the
summoner. The summoner must have a special bond with the target for it to fully
form, which can be developed over the course of a single-phase project. A basic
project for a common being may be:

> <ClockSvg className="w-16 h-16 float-right mr-2 mb-2" currentTicks={0} totalTicks={8} />
> Each round takes a week. Progress is tracked on an 8-tick clock, where a Charisma-based DC 20 conjuration check ticks 1.
> Each round requires 10gp of arcane materials.

This project is only an example that may represent a typical small elemental and
should be modified for larger and more powerful beings. Some may require gifts
before allowing a summoner to call them at any time.

Once a bond is formed, summoning is a simpler process, though still time
consuming. A typical summoning takes 10 minutes and lasts for 1 hour. It is a DC
20 conjuration check, modified by the target's size and the duration of the
summoning and presence of a summoning circle. Alternatively, 10gp (multiplied by
the size's standard multiplier) of arcane materials may be used when within a
summoning circle to avoid the check to get a 10-minute summoning without a
check.

A summoned creature may choose to break its bond with the summoner at any time.
As a result, summoners will often continue to send their powerful bound beings gifts.

### Teleportation

A typical teleportation sends a target from a summoning circle to a chosen
destination, which also has a summoning circle and is familiar to the caster.
Such teleportation takes 10 minutes to cast, can only teleport a target the size
of the smaller conjuration circle. Multiple targets may be teleported, but the
combined size must be within the limit.

If either the starting point or the end point does not have a summoning circle,
a conjuration check must be made:

- DC 20 if only one location is missing a conjuration circle
- DC 25 if both locations are missing a conjuration circle.
- +5 to the DC if the destination is on a different plane

A failure on the roll means the teleportation still occurs but incurs a mishap. (TODO - define mishaps.)

### Modifiers

Duration can be extended:

| Duration | Modifier |
| -------- | -------- |
| 1 minute | -5       |
| 1 hour   | +0       |
| 1 day    | +2       |
| 1 week   | +5       |
| 1 month  | +10      |
| 1 year   | +20      |

# OLD - TODO, remove

Most conjurations are a minor non-combat action - they take too long to be
effective in combat.

The base DC for any summoning is 10, which last for 1 hour, modified as follows:

| Target Description           | Modifier  |
| ---------------------------- | --------- |
| Living Creature              | +level    |
| Living Creature with control | +5x level |
| Fine Object                  | +0        |
| Diminuitive Object           | +1        |
| Tiny Object                  | +2        |
| Small Object                 | +4        |
| Medium Object                | +8        |
| Large Object                 | +16       |
| Huge Object                  | +32       |
| Gargantuan Object            | +64       |
| Colossal Object              | +128      |

Other modifiers for objects include:

| Object Details    | Modifier                                                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Raw materials     | +0                                                       |
| Crafted materials | +DC to create<br/>Or, make an additional crafting check. |
| Metal             | x2                                                       |
| Precious Metal    | x5                                                       |
| Crstaline         | x10                                                      |

Duration can be extended:

| Duration  | Modifier |
| --------- | -------- |
| 1 minute  | -5       |
| 1 hour    | +0       |
| 1 day     | +2       |
| 1 week    | +5       |
| 1 month   | +10      |
| 1 year    | +20      |
| Permanent | +50      |

Teleportation depends on the quantity/size of targets, distance, and accuracy.
Base DCs assume 1 medium-sized creature or equivalent meterials.

| Teleportation       | DC  |
| ------------------- | --- |
| 100 miles           | 15  |
| Anywhere on plane   | 20  |
| Different plane     | 25  |
| Unfamiliar location | +5  |
| General area        | -5  |
| Double targets      | +2  |

DCs for conjurations can be steep. Summoning a creature or object from elsewhere
or from nothing is not easy, but the ritual may be made more reliable through
use of special materials. Spending 100gp per point in the DC in incense, chalk,
and other specially prepared materials can reduce the DC by 1 point.

<p>
	For example, conjuring a permanent large bronze statue made to resemble a specific person (crafting DC 20) would be DC
	192. This can be reduced to a DC 20 check for {new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US').format(192 * (192 - 20) * 100)} gp. If
	the conjurer also were a master sculptor, the base DC would be 152 with an additional DC 20 crafting check, which
	could be reduced to a DC 20 check for
	{' ' + new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US').format(142 * (142 - 20) * 100)} gp. Either way, it would be cheaper for a sculptor
	to acquire the materials through mundane methods if at all possible.
</p>

Conjurers can form a special bond with living spirits summoned repeatedly
without control. Such spirits can take the form of a familiar, special mount, or
many other forms.
