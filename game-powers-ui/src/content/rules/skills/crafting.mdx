# Skill type: Craft

You are trained in a craft, trade, or art, such as alchemy, armor smithing,
carpentry, gemcutting, leatherworking, locksmithing, masonry, shipmaking, or any
number of other crafts.

## Special rules

When selecting Craft, choose which craft, trade, or art you know. You may select
Craft multiple times for each additional craft you wish to learn; your skill
does not stack.
