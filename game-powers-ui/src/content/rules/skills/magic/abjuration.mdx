# Abjuration

Abjurations are protective spells. They create physical or magical barriers,
negate magical or physical abilities, harm trespassers, or even banish the
subject of the spell to another plane of existence.

## Challenge Checkpoints

As protective magic, it is fortunate that abjurations are one of the simpler
forms to master.

### Abjuration Circles

Locations that frequently have abjurations cast upon them typically have
permanent arcane symbols that are primed for abjuration rituals. (See
[Rituals: Preparing a Location](/rules/rituals#Preparing-a-location)).

### Casting an abjuration

| Action                                                                         | Action Type  | DC  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | --- |
| Ward an abjuration circle with an audible alarm                                | Minor Action | 5   |
| Ward an abjuration circle against intrusion                                    | Minor Action | 15  |
| Ward an abjuration circle against other magic                                  | Minor Action | 25  |
| Ward an area (radius 20') with an audible alarm                                | Minor Action | 15  |
| Ward an area (radius 20') against being entered by a type of creature          | Minor Action | 20  |
| Secure a door or container against being opened (+10 DC)                       | Minor Action | 20  |
| Protect a creature from attacks against a type of creature (+2 to one defense) | Minor Action | 15  |

Each of the above actions last for 10x longer than spent creating the effect, or
approximately the next size up. (1 encounter casting lasts for 1 hour, 1 hour
casting lasts for 10 hours, 1 day casting lasts for 1 week.) Casting every day
for 1 week can make the effect last for 1 month, every day for one month can
make it last one year. Effects may be made permanent by increasing the duration
beyond one year.

| Modifier                                           | DC  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Increase duration one step                         | +5  |
| Double the area of effect                          | +5  |
| Apply to all creatures instead of type of creature | +5  |
| Allow exceptions for specific creatures            | +2  |
