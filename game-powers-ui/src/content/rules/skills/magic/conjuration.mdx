# Conjuration

Conjurations can transport creatures or objects over great distances, even from
other planes, or create objects or effects on the spot.

**Creation**: A creation spell manipulates matter to create an object or
creature in the place the spellcaster designates.

**Summoning**: A summoning spell instantly brings a creaure or object to a place
you designate for a period of time. When the spell ends or is dispelled, a
summoned target is instantly sent back to where it came from. A summoned
creature also goes away if it is killed or if its hit points drop to 0. It is
not really dead. It takes the creature 24 hours for the creature to reform where
it was summoned from, during which time it can't be summoned again.

**Teleportation**: A teleportation spell transports one or more creatures or
objects a great distance or even across planes. Teleportation typically moves
targets away from the caster, but a special type of teleportation, known as a
calling, draws creatures or objects to the caster.

Any means of blocking astral travel blocks new conjuration spells.

## Challenge Checkpoints

Preparing a conjuration takes time, careful calculation, and arcane materials.
The complexity of a conjuration depends greatly on many factors, including (but
not limited to) the target locale of the conjuration, the source of the creature
or object, the size of the effect, and even the material makeup of the target.

### Summoning Circles

Conjurers often have a space dedicated for their conjurations to save time by
pre-calculating and permanently inscribing arcane symbols necessary for
conjuration. Prepared locations for conjurations are known as **summoning
circles**, but they may be used for any type of conjuration. (See [Rituals:
Preparing a Location](/rules/rituals#Preparing-a-location)).

A conjuration with a summoning circle causes the DC to be 5 lower unless
otherwise specified.

### Creation

A typical creation is a ritual that takes an hour of time and causes a
medium-size amount of raw mundane materials to appear. More complex creations
can summon more materials, crafted goods, or even precious metals, crystals, or
other valuable resources. While creations are permanent, they don't form
entirely out of nothing - the price is paid for the materials to be transported
from other planes by arcane materials consumed during the ritual.

An amount of arcane materials must be expended roughly equivalent to the cost of
the raw materials to be created. In most cases, it is cost-prohibitive to use
creation conjurations for recovering raw materials. However, where resources are
scarce, creation magic is effective. Water may be summoned in a desert, or stone
in the middle of a jungle.

Crafted materials require prepartion. Conjurers may use their knowledge of the
craft required or their specialized knowledge in conjuration. Such preparation
should be structured as a project that would be roughly equivalent to crafting
the desired shape directly.

Creation rituals require use of a summoning circle.

### Summoning

A typical summoning draws a particular extraplanar creature or object to the
summoner. The summoner must have a special bond with the target for it to fully
form, which can be developed over the course of a single-phase project. A basic
project for a common being may be:

<ProjectPhase
	advancement={[
		{
			check: 'DC 20',
			result: '1 tick'
		}
	]}
	check="CHA + Conjuration skill"
	cost="10gp of arcane materials per round."
	goal="Bond with an Extraplanar Being"
	totalTicks={8}>
	<p>Develop a bond with an extraplanar being. Each round takes a week.</p>
</ProjectPhase>

This project is only an example that may represent a typical small elemental and
should be modified for larger and more powerful beings. Some may require gifts
before allowing a summoner to call them at any time.

Once a bond is formed, summoning is a simpler process, though still time
consuming. A typical summoning takes 10 minutes and lasts for 1 hour. It is a DC
20 conjuration check, modified by the target's size and the duration of the
summoning and presence of a summoning circle. Alternatively, 10gp (multiplied by
the size's standard multiplier) of arcane materials may be used when within a
summoning circle to avoid the check to get a 10-minute summoning without a
check.

A summoned creature may choose to break its bond with the summoner at any time.
As a result, summoners will often continue to send their powerful bonded beings
gifts.

#### Familiars

Familiars are special creatures that form a lifelong bond with a summoner. The
bond between summoner and familiar is so strong that the familiar remains in its
summoned state almost permanently.

Many creatures who become familiars do not have a physical form they would
normally manifest in the material plane; the process of becoming a familiar
grants them such a form. As such, the process of finding a familiar depends on
the form your familiar will take.

A tiny familiar, such as a cat or toad, may require a ritual such as the following:

<ProjectPhase
	advancement={[
		{
			check: 'DC 10',
			result: '1 tick'
		}
	]}
	check="CHA + Conjuration skill"
	cost="10gp of arcane materials per round."
	goal="Bond with a Familiar"
	totalTicks={8}>
	<p>Develop a bond with an extraplanar being to become your familiar. Each round takes a week.</p>
</ProjectPhase>

Like summoned creatures, a familiar may choose to break its bond with the
summoner at any time.

Further conjuration rituals may be developed to improve the link between
conjurer and familiar. Such enhancements may create a shared language, a
telepathic link, the ability to share senses, or much more.

Because most familiars are granted a physical form due to the magic itself, the
form is somewhat maleable. A short (1 hour) ritual may be performed for minor
changes (remaining a tiny creature), but some conjurers have been known to have
temporarily transformed their familiars into great beasts. These rituals require
arcane materials to be spent for the transformation.

### Teleportation

A typical teleportation sends a target from a summoning circle to a chosen
destination, which also has a summoning circle and is familiar to the caster.
Such teleportation takes 10 minutes to cast, can only teleport a target the size
of the smaller conjuration circle. Multiple targets may be teleported, but the
combined size must be within the limit.

If either the starting point or the end point does not have a summoning circle,
a conjuration check must be made:

- DC 20 if only one location is missing a conjuration circle
- DC 25 if both locations are missing a conjuration circle.
- +5 to the DC if the destination is on a different plane

A failure on the roll means the teleportation still occurs but incurs a mishap. (TODO - define mishaps.)

### Modifiers

Duration can be extended:

| Duration | Modifier |
| -------- | -------- |
| 1 minute | -5       |
| 1 hour   | +0       |
| 1 day    | +2       |
| 1 week   | +5       |
| 1 month  | +10      |
| 1 year   | +20      |
