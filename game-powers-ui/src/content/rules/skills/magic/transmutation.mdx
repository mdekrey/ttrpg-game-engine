# Transmutation

Transmutation magic is the ability to transform one thing into another. This can
be as simple as changing the shape or as complex as changing the fundamental
makeup of your target.

## Challenge Checkpoints

Preparing a transmutation takes time, careful calculation, and arcane materials.
The complexity of a transmutation depends greatly on many factors, including (but
not limited to) the original material of the target, the desired material eventual makeup of the target,
the size of the effect, and even the shape and integrity of the result.

### Transmuation Circles

Transmuters often have a space dedicated to save time by
pre-calculating and permanently inscribing arcane symbols necessary for
transmutation. (See [Rituals:
Preparing a Location](/rules/rituals#Preparing-a-location)).

A transmutation with a transmutation circle causes the DC to be 5 lower unless
otherwise specified.
