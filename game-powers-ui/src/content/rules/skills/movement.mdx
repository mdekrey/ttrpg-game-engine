# Skill Type: Movement

_Examples: Athletics, Acrobatics, Flying, Mounts, Swimming, Vehicles_

You are an expert in a single method of movement. If that method includes
special equipment or trained animals, this skill includes maintenance of that
equipment and training of animals for use of this skill.

If moving under your own power, you may use your move action to move up your
speed using that movement style. (For example, you may swim your full speed, or
climb your full speed.) If directing a vehicle or animal, you may use your move
action to control the vehicle's move action and standard action, otherwise the
vehicle will move up to the DM's discretion. (For example, when riding a horse,
you may spend your move action to direct it to run full speed. If you do not use
your move action, the horse may slow down or turn as it desires.)

## Special rules

When selecting Movement, choose which movement style. You may select Movement
multiple times for each additional movement style you wish to learn; your skill
does not stack.
