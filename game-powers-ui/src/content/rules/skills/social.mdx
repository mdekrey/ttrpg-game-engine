# Social

You can influence others by matching your mannerisms, attitude, and speech
patterns to match those around you. When tact and social grace are needed, your
subtlety charms the room. During stern negotiations, you can match a hardened
attitude. In general, those you are influencing will have a better attitude
towards you (whether more positive, higher respect, etc.) after using social.
Social, as a result, does not cover direct deception or intimidation.

In the course of a non-combat encounter, certain situations may be resolved by a
Social check.

## Special rules

When selecting Social, you must select a favored social type and a neglected
social type. For example, you may focus on the nobility and neglect criminal
situations. Certain social powers will reference your favored social type.

| Suggested Social Types |
| ---------------------- |
| Nobility |
| Criminal |
| Laborers |
| Scholars |

Certain circles require special introductions to gain access. Even if your
favored social type is "criminal", you won't be able to call on the head of the
theives' guild from a town in which you just arrived. Open circles, such as
finding a dock workers' guild, may only require a night of carousing to gain
access to leaders, but secret societies may require many weeks' worth of
socializing and making contacts.
