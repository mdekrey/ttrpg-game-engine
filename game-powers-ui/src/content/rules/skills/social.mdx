# Social

You can influence others by matching your mannerisms, attitude, and speech
patterns to match those around you. When tact and social grace are needed, your
subtlety charms the room. During stern negotiations, you can match a hardened
attitude. In general, those you are influencing will have a better attitude
towards you (whether more positive, higher respect, etc.) after using social.
Social, as a result, does not cover direct deception or intimidation.

In the course of a non-combat encounter, certain situations may be resolved by a
Social check.

## Special rules

When selecting Social, you must select a favored social type and a neglected
social type. For example, you may focus on the nobility and neglect criminal
situations. Certain social powers will reference your favored social type.

## Challenge Checkpoints

Example uses of powers with DCs

## Story Concepts

- Who was your main inspiration as a socialite, and why?
- Retell a situation where your social skills failed you.

    Name the NPC and what favor they can grant you. You trade favors you've
    earned to get the benefit you desire. Failure by less than 5 gets you a
    lesser version of the favor. The NPC named must be favorable to you and the
    favor you ask must be relatively similar in magnitude to the one you are
    owed.
