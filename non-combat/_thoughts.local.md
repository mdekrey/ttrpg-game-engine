### Call a Favor

Through a series of favor trading within your circles, you get the assistance you need.

Name the NPC and what favor they can grant you. You trade favors you've earned to get the benefit you desire. Failure by less than 5 gets you a lesser version of the favor. The NPC named must be favorable to you and the favor you ask must be relatively similar in magnitude to the one you are owed.

Recharge: Perform a favor for another NPC. (This can be a quest by itself.)
